<h2>About</h2>


<p>
  I am a doctor of physical therapy and postdoctoral scholar in the <a href="https://www.drew-lab.org" target="_none">Drew Lab @ PSU</a> investigating the neurobiology of movement in both humans and rodent models. This work has two primary aims, one theoretical and one clinical.
</p>

<p>
  The first aim is to <b>understand the energetic coupling between the brain and body during movement</b>. As the brain and skeletal muscle are among the most metabolically costly organs in the body, behavior is done on a budget. Across animals, this budget is balanced in part by adaptively minimizing the mechanical costs of locomotion and respiration. Despite its ubiquity, the neurobiological mechanisms behind energy minimization remain uncertain. This direction of research will answer the questions:

<ul>
  <li> how do neurons adaptively minimize mechanical costs of movement?</li>
  <li> what role do neuroglia and other non-neural cells play in adaptive motor learning?</li>
  <li> what are the energetic demands of movement and stillness in the central nervous system?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
  Currently, I am training in optical measures of cerebral blood flow and neurovascular interactions to begin probing these questions in mouse models with genetically encoded calcium indicators.

  The second aim is to understand <b>the cellular mechanisms underlying the effects of movement-based therapies</b>. Exercise and structured breathing practices have been used in therapeutic and spiritual practices for millenia. For many, these practices are analgesic and anxiolytic; in others, these practices worsen fatigue, impair cognition and even elicit seizures. Common to these practices are episodic metabolic challenge to some set of tissues through repetition: whereas "normal" behaviors show variability and distribute energetic demand across tissues, exercise and regimented breathing practices involve highly repeated, stereotyped stresses. This holds true for skeletal muscle, and equally, neurons. This direction of research will answer the questions:
  <ul>
    <li> how does movement mechanically affect the nervous system?</li>
    <li> what transmitter systems and pathways mediate the therapeutic effect of exercise?</li>
    <li> what drugs may enhance or block the therapeutic effects of these practices?</li>
  </ul>
</p>
      
<p>
  Currently, I am investigating the means by which breathwork and other structured breathing practices influence brain function using a mix of two-photon microscopy and pharmacological testing in a mouse model.
