<h2>About</h2>


<p>
  I am a Doctor of Physical Therapy and postdoctoral scholar in the <a href="https://www.drew-lab.org" target="_none">Drew Lab</a> in the Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics at PSU. I am fundamentally interested in the cellular and computational mechanisms connecting movement and the nervous system. As a clinician-scientist, my aim is to translate these findings to clinical populations, particularly those marginalized by conventional medical and biopsychosocial diagnostic frameworks.</p>
  
<p>
  My training is in clinical orthopedics and bench neuroscience. I completed my bachelor's degree in 2015 as a <a href="https://athletics.ithaca.edu/sports/football/roster/joe-ricotta/11340" target="_none"> four-year varsity letterman for the Ithaca College Bombers football team</a>. I recieved my DPT in 2017 and shortly thereaftere completed residency and obtained board-certification in orthopedic physical therapy. My practice focused on patients with chronic neuropathic pain, usually of non-specific origin. My interest in neural mechanisms led me to a PhD investigating the physics of alpha-motoneuron discharge in fatigue and in patients with Parkinson's disease. Currently, I'm using optical imaging and genetically-encoded calcium indicators in mice to investigate how neurons respond to posturally-induced changes in intracranial pressure. I'm also investigating how postural adjustments in locomoting mice cause brain motion within the skull.</p>

<p>
 In brief, my clinical interests lie in the use of mechanistic neuroscience to understand movement, and how we might translate findings from modern neurobiology to clinical practice in a rehabilitation context. My theoretical interests include the consequences of measurement decisions in both experimental neuroscience and in clinimetric outcomes. I am particularly interested in the intersections between medicine, science and software, and have written <a href="https://github.com/JoeRicotta/ucm" target="_none">software for scientists to analyze movement-related data</a> and for <a href="https://github.com/JoeRicotta/brainreg3D" target="_none">registration of brain imaging onto 3D anatomical templates</a>. Currently, I am exploring the speed and security of <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org" target="_none">Rust</a> to streamline image processing.
